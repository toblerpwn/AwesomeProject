Awesome React Native Project

# Getting Started
How to begin!

## React Native
1. Go here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
2. Click the `Building Projects with Native Code` tab.
3. Follow the instructions for your `Development OS` and _BOTH_ the `iOS` and `Android` OSes.

## Nuclide
1. Go here and follow the instructions: https://nuclide.io/

# Notes
- Live/Hot Reloading only works with one simulator at a time.
- Your Android simulator needs to be running _before_ you execute `react-native run-android` - but the same is not true for `react-native run-ios` (it will start the simiulator for you).
